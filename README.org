* Contents of Repository
- [[file:README.org][README.org]] : The file which you are currently viewing.
- [[file:custom.el][custom.el]] : A file containing variables set through the Emacs customize interface ~M-x customize~.
- [[file:init.el][init.el]] : This is the Emacs configuration file which would normally be placed in the ~.emacs.d/~ directory. *Note: It is recommended that you DO NOT edit this file but rather edit the Org-mode ([[file:init.org][init.org]]) file below. Editing and saving the [[file:init.org][init.org]] will overwrite [[file:init.el][init.el]] as the files are tangled.*
- [[file:init.org][init.org]] : The literate programming file which generates [[file:init.el][init.el]] and contains documentation and descriptions of the code contained in [[file:init.el][init.el]]
- [[runemacs.bat]] : A batch file for windows that will execute the Windows runemacs.exe binary after setting the home directory to the drive label of the device that the batch file was called from. This file is useful for running emacs from a flash drive to create a fully portable Emacs setup.
- [[./straight/versions/default.el]] : A file generated from ~straight-freeze-versions~ containing the current versions of all the packages defined in [[./init.el]].

* Literate Programming with Org-mode
In order to manage the large ~init.el~ configuration file, the configuration is written using Org-mode. There are some reasons for using Org-mode to manage the Emacs configuration.
1. When a change to the configuration is made, it is easy to document why the change was made.
2. Org-mode makes it much easier to navigate a large Emacs configuration as different code blocks can be nested under headings which can be folded or unfolded.
