This repository contains the configuration for my personal Emacs setup.

* Contents of Repository
- [[file:README.org][README.org]] : This file which you are currently viewing.
- [[file:init.el][init.el]] : This is the Emacs configuration file which would normally be placed in the ~.emacs.d/~ directory. *Note: It is recommended that you DO NOT edit this file but rather edit the Org-mode ([[file:init.org][init.org]])file below. Editing and saving the [[file:init.org][init.org]] will overwrite [[file:init.el][init.el]] as the files are tangled.*
- [[file:init.org][init.org]] : The literate programming file which generates [[file:init.el][init.el]] and contains documentation and descriptions of the code contained in [[file:init.el][init.el]]

* Literate Programming with Org-mode
In order to manage the large ~init.el~ configuration file, the configuration is written using Org-mode. There are some reasons for using Org-mode to manage the Emacs configuration.
1. When a change to the configuration is made, it is easy to document why the change was made.
2. Org-mode makes it much easier to navigate a large Emacs configuration as different code blocks can be nested under headings which can be folded or unfolded.
