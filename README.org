This repository contains the configuration for my personal Emacs setup.

* Contents of Repository
This repository contains the following key files and folders:
- [[.mc-lists.el]] :: A file generated automatically from Emacs [[https://github.com/magnars/multiple-cursors.el][multiple-cursors]] with my saved preferences.
- [[file:custom.el][custom.el]] :: A file containing variables set through the Emacs customize interface ~M-x customize~.
- [[./elisp/]] :: A folder containing my personal elisp files. These files are code which I am working with that with either become an Emacs package in the future or are used for small hacks and fixes.
- [[gnus.el]] :: The configuration file for the Emacs Gnus news and mail reader. *Note: It is recommended that you DO NOT edit this file but rather edit the Org-mode file ([[file:gnus.org][gnus.org]]) below. Editing and saving the [[file:gnus.org][gnus.org]] will overwrite [[gnus.el]] as the files are tangled.*
- [[gnus.org]] :: A literate programming file which generate [[gnus.el]] and contains commentary on the code in [[gnus.el]].
- [[file:init.el][init.el]] :: This is the Emacs configuration file that is loaded during Emacs startup. *Note: It is recommended that you DO NOT edit this file but rather edit the Org-mode file ([[file:init.org][init.org]]) below. Editing and saving the [[file:init.org][init.org]] will overwrite [[file:init.el][init.el]] as the files are tangled.*
- [[file:init.org][init.org]] :: A literate programming file which generates [[file:init.el][init.el]] and contains commentary on the code contained in [[file:init.el][init.el]]
- [[file:README.org][README.org]] :: The file which you are currently viewing.
- [[runemacs.bat]] :: A batch file for windows that will execute the Windows runemacs.exe binary after setting the home directory to the drive label of the device that the batch file was called from. This file is useful for running emacs from a flash drive to create a fully portable Emacs setup.
- [[./straight/versions/default.el]] :: A file generated from ~straight-freeze-versions~ containing the current versions of all the packages defined in [[./init.el]].

* Literate Programming with Org-mode
In order to manage the large ~init.el~ configuration file, the configuration is written using Org-mode. There are some reasons for using Org-mode to manage the Emacs configuration.
1. When a change to the configuration is made, it is easy to document why the change was made.
2. Org-mode makes it much easier to navigate a large Emacs configuration as different code blocks can be nested under headings which can be folded or unfolded.

* About This Repository
I have made this repository public as I have found inspiration from looking at the configuration of other Emacs users and thought that I would post this publicly in the small possibility that even one person might find this useful. Everything in this repository has been gathered from the GNU Emacs manual or sites that have been scoured from the internet in my quest to get Emacs to behave in the manner that fits my workflow.
** Stars
If you like this configuration, please star it by clicking the star button at the top of the page. If I get enough stars, I will consider making a public, community-driven repository of this configuration for general use.
** Issues
If you like what you see here and you want to use this configuration yourself, that is fantastic. Feel free to clone this repository for yourself or make a fork of it as you see fit.

While this is my personal Emacs configuration, I have left the [[https://github.com/tfree87/.emacs.d/issues][issues]] section open if anyone finds any errors that I may have missed and I will be grateful to your reporting of any issues that you find, however, keep the following in mind when you report any issues:
- The [[https://github.com/tfree87/.emacs.d/issues][issues]] page is mainly for /bugs/ or /typos/ that you have discovered and want to report.
- This repository is my personal configuration and therefore reflects my personal taste in how I use Emacs. If you like this configuration but would prefer different themes, keybindings, or different packages then I would recommend forking this repository for your own use.
- If you have /suggestions/ for improving this configuration, feel free to post an issue to this repository and I will consider it as I am open to new ideas, however, *do not count on it being incorporated into this repository.* Once again, I would recommend forking the repository.

* Features
This Emacs configuration is implemented with the following 
- Portable :: This configuration is designed to work under both Linux /and/ Windows. It has been tested in Linux Mint, on Raspberry Pi OS, Windows 10, and Windows 11. It is also designed to run quickly from a flash drive with [[file:runemacs.bat][runemacs.bat]].
- Fast :: I am always trying to make Emacs run as fast as possible as I am often on slow machines and running Emacs from a flash drive /really/ slows things down. Nearly every package has loading deferred.
- Default Keybindings :: When possible, the default keybindings are used. Emacs was my first text editor and I have learned and memorized many of the keybindings from reading through the Emacs manual. This version of Emacs is /not/ designed for Evil.
* Rationale
Many of you might be asking:
#+begin_quote
"Why create another custom Emacs configuration when there are modular versions of Emacs out there such as [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][Doom Emacs]] and [[https://www.spacemacs.org/][Spacemacs]]?"
#+end_quote
The reasons for creating my own custom version are below:
1. Vanilla Emacs was my first experience with serious text editing. Unlike many users who have switched from Vim to Emacs, I started as an Emacs user from the beginning. This led to:
   1. I learned the default Emacs keybindings from the GNU Emacs manual and I am not interested in switching to vi keybindings. I have become so accustomed to Emacs keys that I find I try to use them everywhere as they have become muscle memory.
   2. I have found J. Wiegly's [[https://jwiegley.github.io/use-package/][use-package]] to be modular enough that I don't need a modular system such as Spacemacs or Doom Emacs.
   3. Having spent a lot of time reading the GNU Emacs manual, I feel more comfortable editing my own init.el file rather than having to learn how to wrangle with Spacemacs or Doom Emacs init files.
2. Creating my own Emacs customization has allowed me to learn a lot about Emacs Lisp.
3. I have been able to incorporate code into my Emacs configuration that makes it flexible enough to run on multiple operating systems and even as a portable Windows app without too many features being broken.

To summarize, this configuration was created by an Emacs user who /started out/ as an Emacs user and doesn't want to relearn new keys and enjoys customizing.

In an open source world, sharing is caring. This configuration would not be the way it is without the work of others who were also willing to share their configurations:
