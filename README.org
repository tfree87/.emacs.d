This repository contains the configuration for my personal Emacs setup.

* Repository Contents
** init.org
~init.org~ is a "literate programming" file that is used to generate the ~init.el~ file which Emacs uses to run. The file contains commentary, descriptions, and code blocks that describe the Emacs configuration for reference. The code blocks are "tangled" to the ~init.el~ file so that every time that ~init.org~ is saved, the ~init.el~ file is regenerated using code from the source code blocks.

The reason for this is that composing in org-mode is faster, easier to read, breaks the code down into sections, is easily exportable, and the comments can be read directly in Githug by clicking on the ~init.org~ file and previewing it.
** init.el
This is the Emacs configuration file that is created from "tangling" the ~init.org~ file. Emacs reads this file upon startup to set the configuration options, install packages, and run startup scripts.

*Do not edit this file directly!* All changes to ~init.el~ need to be made in ~init.org~ as any time ~init.org~ is saved, it will *overwrite* any changes made in ~init.el~.
